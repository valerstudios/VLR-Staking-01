# UI Components for EVLR Staking 
This includes three components required to build a staking UI for EVLR v1 staking contracts.  The three components handle connection to metamask, display statistics for the staking pool, and enable connected users to stake their tokens.  

# Dependencies
We use the following libraries to build components:
- React Metamask detection (http://www.github.com/YannyD/react-metamask-connection-tool)
- Material UI
- Styled Components

# Implementation
To implement:
1.) Replace the deployment folder with one generated by hardhat-deploy for the EVLR staking contract.
2.) Ensure the correct json replaced the MochEVLR1.json file or simply add the necessary ABI and Address information the constants file inside of utils
3.) While individual components can be used without others, the useStaker.js file must be included in your repo.
